# Release 1.6.0 
## Key Features
### MLSpace Groups
- Administrators can now create Groups in MLSpace!
- Administrators can manage user membership for the Groups.
- Users can now associate Groups with Datasets, expanding permissions beyond the Global, Project, and Private options. This allows teams working across projects to access Datasets easily.
- Users can get a detailed view of the Groups to see which Groups they are a part of and the other members of their Groups.

### User Details
- Admins can now drill down to get more details about individual users
- This will allow admins to see what access a user has to projects and groups on a single page

## Bug Fixes
- Standardize enum and EnvVariable usage
- Documentation readability improvements
- Various fixes across the dataset and project management pages

## Coming Soon
- 1.6.1 is targeted for end of July where the team will be delivering the ability to add the newly released groups as project collaborators or project owners. This permission scheme will be inherited by every member of the group. The team will also be adding multi group support for datasets, where datasets can be shared with multiple groups for use within their member's projects.
